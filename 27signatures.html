          It all started with a cancelled baseball game in New York City.
          Instead of catching a fly ball, I found myself capturing something far
          more unique: signatures. Not just any signatures, but those of
          everyday New Yorkers, each one a snapshot of connection in the city's
          magnificent chaos. New York, a place I’d dreamt of for years, truly
          came alive through these interactions – from the comic book vendor to
          the MoMA security guard. Each mark on that baseball tells a story, a
          vibrant reflection of the city's raw, unfiltered spirit.

          Fast forward a couple years later to October 2024 and I'm going on a
          trip to Japan with a group of friends for the first time. We're all
          into photography and I remembered Baseball is huge in Japan so I
          thought it'd be fun to take my project there. I made the decision to
          only do this in Tokyo despite travelling across the country to be
          symmetric with the NYC project. Although I met a bunch of amazing
          people in Tokyo some of my favourite interactions were from other
          cities! I guess those memories will just be for me. I knew there would
          be a language barrier so I rushed to get a website up and running
          which I wanted to build for ages but didn't have time until the advent
          of LLMs. This along with a friendly smile and broken Japanese helped
          bridge any gaps. The signatures I collected in Tokyo beautifully
          capture the diverse spirit of its residents.

          One thing I found really interesting was in the US most people signed
          their own name, many Japanese participants proudly represented their
          businesses. I think this shows the difference in American individualism
          and Japanese collectivism.

          Every signature I’ve collected, whether in the bustling streets of New
          York or the vibrant avenues of Tokyo, represents a meaningful cultural
          exchange. They're more than just names; they're stories of the amazing
          people I've met.

          I also started posting TikToks about the project you can find here.
          Unfortunately life got in the way and I stopped posting. I'm hoping to
          finish by the end of the year.

          The second part of this blog will delve into how I built the website.
          It's pretty interesting how it all came together. At least I think so.
