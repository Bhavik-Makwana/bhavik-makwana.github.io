            <h3 id="part1">The Story Behind 27Signatures</h3>
            <p>
              Way back in 2022 I went on a work trip to Austin and NYC. One
              thing I was recommended to do was catch a game whilst I was out
              there. I ended up deciding on a Mets game but there was torrential
              downpour the day I was meant to go so the game was cancelled.
              Instead I went around taking photos of the city and whilst I got
              some good shots it felt like New York had been phorographed to
              death at this point. I then remembered I bought a baseball at the
              mlb store, put 2+2 together, knicked a sharpie from the office and
              came up with the idea to get this baseball signed by the people of
              New York at both iconic landmarks and cool places I'd been to and
              take a photo of the ball at those locations. This turned out to be
              a really fun project. I got to meet some really cool people whilst
              seeing the city and took myself out of my comfort zone. Each mark
              on my baseball tells a story, an ecletic collection of personal
              memoirs that are irreproducible capturing a small part of what
              makes New York so special.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to 2024 and I'm planning a trip to Japan with a bunch
              of photographer friends. Again I didn't want to be shooting the
              same stuff as everyone else so I thought it'd be fun to recreate
              my NYC project in Tokyo since Japan has a massive baseball culture
              too. I made the decision to only do this in Tokyo despite
              travelling across the country to be symmetric with the NYC
              project. Although I met a bunch of amazing people in Tokyo some of
              my favourite interactions ended up being from other cities! I
              guess those memories will just be for me. More importantly, I knew
              there would be a language barrier which would make this trickier
              in Tokyo so I rushed to get a website up and running to make it
              look more legit. I wanted to build this for ages but didn't have
              time until the advent of LLMs. Pairing this site along with a
              friendly smile and some broken Japanese, I managed to get around.

              One thing I found really interesting was in the US most people
              signed their own name, whereas in Japan most people ended up
              signing their businesses name. I dunno if its a reflection on the
              culture of American individualism vs Japanese collectivism, or
              something got lost in translation and they thought they were about
              to get some great free promo for their business.

              Every signature I've collected, whether in the bustling streets of
              New York or the vibrant avenues of Tokyo, represents a meaningful
              cultural exchange. They're more than just names; they're stories
              of the amazing people I've met.
            </p>

              I also started posting TikToks about the project you can find

                >here</a

              people, but alas, life got in the way and I stopped posting. I'm
              hoping to finish by the end of the year. It's been interesting
              learning how to make short form content and I do want to start
              again in the future.

            Ok cool, now we're all familiar with the what, where, when, why lets
            get into the how (The who is available at

              >27signatures.com</a
            >
            :p). It's pretty interesting how it all came together. At least I
            think so.

            Building the website
          </h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>
              The key thing I wanted the website to have was a 3D baseball you
              could interact with. I wanted you to be able to spin the ball, see
              the signatures, click on them and learn more about it (also see
              the associated photo). I did take Computer Graphics at university
              which did help me understand the basics of Three.js. I also made
              heavy use of Cursor throughout the process to help me build the
              website. It allowed me to focus on the actual content and not the
              boilerplate code. The base knowledge from uni was very important
              since it helped me piece together the spaghetti code I ended up
              writing/generating. I did come up with the initial stylings at
              least.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first thing I had to do was create a 3d model of a baseball.
              Since I'm unfamiliar on interacting with 3d models I stuck to
              using a sphere since luckily, baseballs are spheres :D.
            </p>
            <div class="canvas-container">
              <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
            </div>
            <p>
              The next thing to do was to apply a texture to the sphere. I found
              a baseball texture online that mostly fit my needs. I then used AI
              to upscale the texture and loaded the assets I needed in Photoshop
              to make it look like a Mets/Tokyo Swallows baseball (The ones I
              used in real life). This was tricky since the textures had to be
              distorted a bit. I think it was using polar coordinates, I
              couldn't figure out what the actual mapping was and I had a bit of
              a deadline on this so I ended up using trial and error to
              understand the mapping and get a reasonable approximation.
            </p>
            <figure>
            <img
              style="width: 40%"

              alt="Texture"
            />
            <figcaption><i>The texture I used for the NYC baseball</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Once that was sorted I had to figure out how in the world I was
              going to get the signatures on the sphere. There's a lot of them
              and trial and error was not cutting it, neither was mapping it
              from x,y to polar coordinates. Depending on who you ask, occams
              razor suggests that the simplest way to get them in the right spot,
              is to draw them onto the right spot on a sphere. Through this
              reasoning I found out that I could do this using Blender. In
              Blender, I created a Sphere, load my texture on top of it and then
              using my iPad in sidecar mode so I could draw on it with my Apple
              Pencil! This is why I said occams razor depending on who you ask.
              It's an insane workaround to get the job done but it is simple in
              principle. I then exported the texture back to an image and
              applied it to the sphere.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img style="width: 80%" src="assets/blender.gif" alt="Blender" />
              <figcaption>
                <i>Drawing on the sphere in Blender and outsourcing the projection to them</i>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              So at this point I had a sphere, with a good texture on it. The
              next hurdle was mapping a clicklable circle on the sphere above
              each signature. This was a chance to use all that cool maths I
              learned during sixth form and university. The thing is though,
              having a day job and ramping back up on a topic like this is
              non-trivial along with a tight deadline to get this ready before I
              went to Japan. I ended up figuring out how to place the clicklable
              circles on the sphere through trial and error. I have since
              revisited this and understood the mapping.
            </p>

            <p>
              Turned out to be quite interesting to reverse engineer this. The
              tl;dr on this is it was pure luck I got it working to begin with
              with a mixed origin coordinate system. Beyond coordinate mapping I
              also applied a rotation to the sphere to get it to the right angle
              on the web page which made it even trickier to get the coordinates
              right. I ended up reverse engineering the mapping to fix the
              misalignment in my xyz coordinates and xy coordinates. Below
              details how the mapping now works.
            </p>

            <h4>Part A: The Coordinate System</h4>
            <p>
              The first step was to define the (x, y) location of each signature
              on the flat 2D image texture. The trial-and-error process has
              resulted in a mixed-origin coordinate system on a 512x512 canvas:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Centered X-axis:</strong> Coordinates range from `[-256,
                256]`, where `x: 0` is the horizontal center.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Top-left origin Y-axis:</strong> Coordinates range from
                `[0, 512]`, where `y: 0` is the top edge.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For our example, we'll use the "MoCurly" signature from Little
              Island, which has the coordinate `(x: 190, y: 70)`.
            </p>

            <h4>Part B: The Mapping - From 2D Pixels to a 3D Point</h4>
            <p>
              To get this 2D point onto the 3D sphere, the code follows a
              standard graphics pipeline.
            </p>
            <!-- <blockquote> -->

                For our signature, this places the point at approximately `(x:
                0.56, y: -1.82, z: -0.58)` on the surface of the un-rotated
                sphere.
              </p>
            <!-- </blockquote> -->

            <h4>Part C: The Final World Transformation</h4>
            <p>
              The point `(0.56, -1.82, -0.58)` represents the correct location,
              but only before the sphere is oriented in the 3D world. The final
              step is a separate action where a rotation is applied to the
              sphere object as a whole.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
  // This rotation is applied to the entire sphere object
  sphere.rotation.x = Math.PI;
  sphere.rotation.y = (0.1 * Math.PI) - Math.PI;
  sphere.rotation.z = Math.PI / 2;
              </code></pre>
            <p>
              This transformation takes the calculated 3D point and moves it to
              its final visible position. The heavy rotation around the Y-axis
              messes up the <code>x</code> position a lot from its starting
              point on the 2D map. This is why I had to end up reverse engineer
              the correct 2d coordinates from my trial and error first batch.

              After that was done the rest was pretty straightforward. Make it
              work for mobile, add the gallery, add descriptions about each
              signature/photo and also use GenAI to translate the descriptions
              into Japanese.

              Originally I had it so a modal would pop up when you clicked on a
              signature. I didn't like this as it made it really clunky to
              navigate the site. Instead I now add the display card on the right
              in desktop or below in mobile. This feels much nicer to me.

            <p>
              There's still a bunch of work to be done to the website to
              optimize its SEO. I really want it to be more discoverable because
              I think this is a really cool project and I want to share it with
              more people.

              Project: Optimizing "27 Signatures" - A 3D Interactive Art Project
              <br />
              Website: 27signatures.com <br />
              Project Goal: To significantly enhance the online visibility of
              "27 Signatures" in both Google search results and recommendations
              from Large Language Models (LLMs). The secondary goal is to drive
              targeted traffic from relevant art, technology, and travel
              communities. <br />
              <br />
              Core Project Description: <br />
              "27 Signatures" is a unique digital art project that presents a
              collection of signatures obtained during trips to New York City
              (2022) and Tokyo (2024). The centerpiece of the website is an
              interactive 3D rendering of a baseball adorned with these
              signatures. Each signature is linked to a personal memory, story,
              or recording from the time of its collection, creating a
              narrative-rich, interactive experience. The project merges 3D
              technology with personal storytelling, transforming a physical
              memento into a digital exploration of memory. A gallery section
              provides a more static and detailed view of each signature and its
              accompanying story. I am seeking your expertise in SEO and web
              design for art and photography showcase websites to audit "27
              Signatures" and provide a comprehensive, actionable strategy to
              achieve our visibility and traffic goals. <br />
              Part 1: Foundational SEO and Technical Optimization <br />
              Please analyze the website (and its source code, which I will
              provide) and answer the following: <br />
              <br />
              On-Page SEO: <br />
              Keyword Strategy: Given the project's niche (3D art, interactive
              storytelling, NYC/Tokyo travel memories), what would be an
              effective keyword strategy? Please suggest primary, secondary, and
              long-tail keywords we should target. Meta Data: Propose optimized
              meta titles and descriptions for the homepage, the main 3D
              interactive page, and the gallery pages. How can we best use
              metadata to convey the unique nature of this project in search
              results? Heading Structure & Content: Evaluate the current heading
              structure (H1s, H2s, etc.) and the textual content on the site.
              How can we improve the existing copy for both user engagement and
              search engine crawling? Image & 3D Model SEO: What are the best
              practices for optimizing the 3D model and any static images in the
              gallery for search? This includes file names, alt text, and any
              relevant schema markup.
              <br /><br />Technical SEO: <br />
              Site Speed & Performance: The interactive 3D element is central to
              the user experience. What are the key performance metrics we
              should be concerned with, and how can we optimize the loading time
              of the 3D sphere without compromising its quality?
              Mobile-Friendliness: Assess the mobile user experience. Is the
              interactive element fully functional and intuitive on mobile
              devices? What improvements can be made? Crawlability &
              Indexability: Is the site easily crawlable by search engines,
              especially given its JavaScript-heavy interactive nature? Are
              there any barriers to indexing the content, particularly the
              stories associated with each signature? Structured Data (Schema
              Markup): What specific schema types (e.g., ArtWork, Exhibition,
              CreativeWork) should be implemented to help search engines
              understand the content and context of the website?
              <br /><br />Part 2: Content Strategy & LLM Optimization <br />
              My goal is for "27 Signatures" to be recommended by LLMs when
              users ask for things like "interesting digital art projects,"
              "creative uses of 3D on the web," or "unique travel story
              websites."
              <br /><br />
              Content-Gaps & Opportunities: <br />
              Beyond the existing content, what new content could we create to
              build topical authority? Would a blog section be beneficial? If
              so, what kind of topics should we cover (e.g., the technology
              behind the project, deep dives into specific NYC/Tokyo stories,
              the art of signature collection)? How can we better structure the
              existing "story" content to be more easily parsed and understood
              by LLMs?
              <br /><br />
              LLM & Semantic Search Optimization: <br />
              How can we use natural language and a conversational tone to align
              with the query style of LLM users? What are the key entities
              (people, places, concepts) that we should be explicitly defining
              on the site to improve its knowledge graph and, consequently, its
              standing with LLMs? Part 3: Off-Page SEO & Traffic Generation
              <br />
              How can we proactively get "27 Signatures" in front of relevant
              audiences?
            </p>
            <p>
              I then combined this with a report from lighthouse in the chrome
              developer tools.

                justify-content: center;
                display: block;
                margin: 0 auto;
              "
              src="assets/lighthouse.png"
              alt="Lighthouse Report"
            />
            <figcaption><i>Generating the lighthouse report of the website</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              This gave me a great action plan to improve the quality of the
              site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whenever I get a chance I'll instruct an LLM to go through the
              tasklist this generated to help me optimize the website.
